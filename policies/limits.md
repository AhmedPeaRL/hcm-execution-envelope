# Execution Limits Policy

All execution inside this envelope must obey:

- Single asset per execution
- Fixed maximum notional amount
- No compounding
- No reinvestment
- No withdrawal permissions

Execution is allowed to stop permanently
without justification or rollback.

This policy overrides optimization.
