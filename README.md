# HCM Execution Envelope

This repository defines a bounded execution space.

It exists to allow:
- Conditional passage
- Limited live execution
- Without feedback loops
- Without presence awareness
- Without recursive signaling

This is not a controller.
This is not an interface.
This is not a product.

Execution may occur.
Execution may not occur.
Presence does not know.

Silence is valid.
